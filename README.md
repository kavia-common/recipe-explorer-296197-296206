This project’s frontend runs fully static (no runtime envs, no network calls) using in-memory mock data. See `recipe_explorer_frontend/README.md` for details and how to re-enable API mode if needed.

Favorites: The app includes a local-only Favorites feature persisted in browser localStorage (`recipe_favorites`). See the frontend README for usage.
